# Darksky

[darksky-influxdb](https://github.com/ErwinSteffens/darksky-influxdb) pulls in weather data for your location every 2 minutes from [Darksky](http://darksky.net/) and saves it to your [InfluxDB](/software/influxdb) instance.

You need to get an API key first from [Darksky](http://darksky.net/dev/)

## Access

There is no direct access to it, but you can create graphs in [Grafana](/software/grafana) to visualize it.
